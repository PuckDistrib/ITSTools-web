<h1>Using ITS modeler to design composite systems.</h1>
<p>
	The ITS Modeler front-end for its-tools can be used to model and analyze ITS compositions
	of systems wrapped into ITS, such as GAL, Time Petri nets or other compositions hierarchically.

<h3><a name="ssec:composite"></a>1. The Composite ITS formalism</h3>


<p>Similarly to above, create a new Composite model :
	"New->Other...->Coloane->Model", select the "ITS Composite" formalism,
	and provide a name. Note that we want the "Model" entry not the "ITS
	composition" which allows to prepare analysis.</p>

<p>The features available for modeling are the following :</p>
<img src="images/compositeFeatures.png" alt="download" />

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Synchronization :
		<ul>
			<li>Name : a name for the synchronization, not semantic but may
				be used in traces. Try to give a different name to each
				synchronization.</li>
			<li>Label : a label for this synchronization, exported as the
				public label of this action. This label is semantic, if it is left
				empty the synchronization is local otherwise the synchronization can
				only fire if triggered externally by a synchronization targetting
				this label. Labeled synchronizations are represented with a double
				edge, like public TPN transitions. When several synchronizations
				"s_1,..s_N" bear the same public label "l", asking this composite to
				fire "l" requires ANY ONE OF the "s_i" to fire.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Instance :
		<ul>
			<li>Name : a name for this instance, used to name the nested
				variables used in the logic. A variable "P1" of an instance "o" is
				accessed by the notation "o.P1" when queried in the logic. The
				instance name is otherwise irrelevant, but each instance of a
				Composite should have a different name.</li>
			<li>Type : a string that denotes an abstract type for this
				instance. This type name does not need to correspond to any existing
				type, it is just a placeholder for a concrete type that will be
				specified separately. It thus defines a parameter for the enclosing
				Composite type, that will be fixed to an apropriate value prior to a
				given verification run. If several instances of a composite use the
				same Type name, this only produces one configuration parameter for
				the composite type.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Edges between instance and synchronization : Synchronization
		part. These edges are not oriented and bear a list of labels. A given
		synchronization can connect to many instances, but only one
		synchronization part should connect a given synchronization and a
		given instance.

		<ul>
			<li>labels : a list of labels, that are added to the actions of
				the connected synchronization. These labels should be separated by
				semi columns ";". The semantics of using several labels on a
				synchronization part is sequential composition of the corresponding
				actions.</li>
			<li>When defining labels on synchronization parts, the connected
				instance is automatically updated to show its "required interface",
				i.e. the list of public labels a given type must define. All labels
				on synchronization parts must exist in the connected type.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="ssec:bind"></a>2. Binding types to instances</h3>

<p>To bind a concrete type to an instance, you need to build an "ITS
	composition model" that will allow to wrap the specification into the
	ITS framework.</p>
<p>We are going to explain how to do this using the "Train Crossing"
	example of the distribution. Obtain it by
	"File->New->Example->Coloane->Train Crossing"</p>

<p>There already is an ITS composition model, but let us build a
	second one, step by step. Select "File->New->Other->Coloane->ITS
	Composition model" and give it a name.</p>

<p>Then import all the models (.model) of your project into the ITS
	type referential, by multi-selecting (with ctrl-click and/or
	shift-click) the models and then drag and drop the group into the
	"Types Declaration" frame.</p>
<img src="images/dragdropall.png" alt="download" />

<p>If you select the newly imported models, you will see for each
	one its exported interface, i.e. the set of public labels it declares
	if any. You can also open any of the models by double-clicking it, or
	by selecting the "Open Editor" button. Note that after modifying the
	actual models, you should save them, then select the "Refresh" button
	to ensure synchronization between this interface and the actual models.
	Observe for instance that "controller_v1" and "controller_v2" while
	being different TPN, both offer the same public interface.</p>
<img src="images/compositionFeatures.png" alt="download" />

<p>If you select the "Controller" child of the "ControlledGate"
	model, you will see the required interface of this type, i.e. the set
	of action labels the bound type must offer. By clicking the "Effective
	Type", you can choose to bind a type you have imported in the
	referential to this Composite model. The "Type binding" drop list only
	proposes compatible types, whose offered interface is a superset of the
	required interface. When you have bound all the types, the composite
	definition is fully reaized. The tree browser on the left helps to
	explore the children of a composition.</p>

<p>The "TrainCrossing.xmlits" composition model presents several
	possible assemblies of a full system.</p>

<h2><a name="sec:scalEdit"></a>III. Using the Scalar Set ITS editor</h2>

<h3><a name="ssec:composite"></a>1. The Scalar and Circular Set ITS	formalism</h3>


<p>Similarly to above, create a new Circular Set Composite model :
	"New->Other...->Coloane->Model", select the "Circular Set Composite"
	formalism, and provide a name. The Circular Set and Scalar Set are very
	similar, but Circular has the additional concept of circular
	synchronization to connect "adjacent" instances in a ring topology.</p>

<p>The features available for modeling are the following :</p>
<img src="images/circularFeatures.png" alt="download" />

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Instance (set of) : there should be only ONE instance node in
		each model. It represents a set of instances of a given type.
		<ul>
			<li>Type : a string that denotes an abstract type for the
				instances in this set. This type name does not need to correspond to
				any existing type, it is just a placeholder for a concrete type that
				will be specified separately, in the ITS composition editor.</li>
			<li>Name : there is no name field in an instance set definition.
				The nested instances are accessed in the logic using integers from 0
				to "size-1".</li>
			<li>Size : The size of the set is specified as an attribute of
				the model rather than the instance, simply click anywhere on the
				background to see the "size" property. This integer allows to
				determine how many instances are connected. The default value of
				size is the integer expression "$SIZE" allowing to delay the
				specification of the size until you want a given verification run.
		</ul>
	<li>Delegator : a symmetric synchronization of the instances in
		the set.
		<ul>
			<li>Label : a label for this delegator, that is both the label
				of this acton if it is declared public, and the label of the action
				invoked on the instances of the set. Delegator labels are added to
				the required interface of the contained type.</li>
			<li>Visibility : either Public or Private. Private transitions
				do not export their label, and may be fired any time they are
				locally enabled. Public delegators cannot be fired unless triggered
				by an outside synchronization, that targets the appropriate label.
				Public delegators are graphically represented with a double border.
				When several synchronizations bear the same public label "l", asking
				this TPN to fire "l" requires ANY ONE OF the transitions labeld "l"
				to fire.</li>
			<li>Kind : either ANY or ALL. Firing an ANY delegator with label
				"a" forces ONE OF the contained instances to fire action "a". Firing
				an ALL delegator with label "a" forces ALL instances to
				synchronously fire action "a".</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Arcs : an arc should connect each delegator or circular
		synchronization to the set of instances. This arc bears no labels, and
		is introduced mostly by homogeneity with the Composite formalism. The
		tool expects an arc to be there, disconnected synchronizations are a
		modeling mistake..</li>
	<li>Circular Synchronization :
		<ul>
			<li>Label : a label for this circular synchronization, that is
				the label of this acton if it is declared public. Otherwise the
				label is not semantic.</li>
			<li>Visibility : either Public or Private. See above explanation
				for delegators.</li>
			<li>Current, Successor : these fields may contain a semi-column
				separated list of action labels. The interpretation is that to fire
				the circular synchronization, for any "i" in [0, size-1], instance
				with index "i" must fire the sequence of labels in "current", and
				instance with index "(i+1) modulo size" must fire the sequence of
				labels in "succ". Labels mentionned in either of these fields are
				added to the nested type's required interface.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="ssec:bindscal"></a>2. Binding types to instances</h3>

<p>
	Binding of a concrete type to an instance, and of a size to a scalar or
	circular set is accomplished similarly to binding a type of a
	composite. Please <a href="composite.php#ssec:bind">refer to section "binding parameters to variables"</a> for
	more details.
