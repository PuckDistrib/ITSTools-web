        <h2>What are ITS tools</h2>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">libITS</span> is a C++ library for model-checking of various formalisms using libDDD. 
        It defines instantiable transition systems (ITS), a simple labeled transition system semantics, in a symbolic way. The <span style="font-weight: bold">its-tools</span> are built on top
        of libITS and support model-checking of ITS models.</p>
        <p>Main features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instantiable Transition System as a framework, allow hierarchical composition of components specified in diverse formalisms.
          </li>
          <li>Optimized implementation taking full advantage of the features of libDDD, notably automatic saturation and hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Support for Petri nets and some of their extensions</li>
          <li>Support for discrete time in models such as Time Petri nets and their compositions</li>
          <li>Support for GAL format input which offers rich data manipulation. </li>
          <li>Support for ETF format input which is produced by the tool LTSmin from diverse formalisms. </li>
          <li>Support for Divine format input which is native to the tool Divine and used in BEEM models. </li>
          <li>Support for CTL model checking using forward transition relation.</li>
          <li>Support for LTL model checking using some classic and some original algorithms that exploit saturation.</li>
        </ul>
